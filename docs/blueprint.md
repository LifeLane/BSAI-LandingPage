# **App Name**: BlockSmithAI Landing Page

## Core Features:

- Layout Replication: Landing page layout mirroring the structure of chaingpt.org.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#4B0082), for a sophisticated and innovative feel.
- Background color: Light grey (#F0F0F0), to provide a clean and neutral backdrop that allows the content and graphics to stand out.
- Accent color: Electric Purple (#BF00FF), to draw attention to calls to action.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif, for a techy look. Body font: 'Inter', sans-serif. Using 'Space Grotesk' for titles will complement the cutting-edge aesthetic, while 'Inter' ensures readability for the bulk of the text.
- Modern, minimalist icons that reflect BlockSmithAI's AI and tech focus, similar to those used on chaingpt.org.
- Maintain the same landing page sections and structure as chaingpt.org, including header, hero section, features overview, and call-to-action.
